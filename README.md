# Unemployment-Project-NYS-2020

This was a group project for EAS 503 that sought out to research the implications and relationships between households' variables and unemployment insurance claims in 2020 in New York state. We used multiple python libraries and machine learning techniques to mine/expose relationships of the NYS unemployment dataset.
